# Hi, I’m Abdulshakur Ahmed (Hanad)

### Payment Systems Architect | Full-Stack Engineer | Builder of Financial Infrastructure

I design and implement secure, scalable financial systems — from national instant payment infrastructure to distributed microservice platforms.

Currently leading payment switch architecture and ISO 20022 integrations, while building **Helios**, an SME Operating System designed to modernize how small and medium businesses operate across emerging markets.

Helios is built to simplify operations, enforce real accounting discipline, enable automation, and give SMEs the infrastructure they need to scale with confidence.

If you want, I can make it slightly sharper and more “World Bank review ready” while still keeping GitHub-friendly tone.
